module Firecrawl 

  ##
  # The +CrawlRequest+ class encapsulates a crawl request to the Firecrawl API. After creating 
  # a new +CrawlRequest+ instance you can begin crawling by calling the +submit+ method and 
  # then subsequently retrieving the results by calling the +retrieve+ method.
  #
  # You can also optionally cancel the crawling operation by calling +cancel+.
  #
  # === examples
  #
