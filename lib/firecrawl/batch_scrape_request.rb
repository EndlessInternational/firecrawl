module Firecrawl 

  ##
  # The +BatchScrapeRequest+ class encapsulates a batch scrape request to the Firecrawl API. 
  # After creating a new +BatchScrapeRequest+ instance you can begin batch scraping by calling 
  # the +submit+ method and then subsequently retrieve the results by calling the 
  # +retrieve' method.
  #
  # === examples
  # 
  # require 'firecrawl'
  #
  # request = Firecrawl::BatchScrapeRequest.new( api_key: ENV[ 'FIRECRAWL_API_KEY' )
  #
  # urls = [ 'https://example.com', 'https://icann.org' ]
  # options = Firecrawl::ScrapeOptions.build do 
  #   format                [ :markdown, 'screenshot@full_page' ]
  #   only_main_content     true
  # end
  # 
  # batch_response = request.submit( urls, options )
  # while response.success?
  #   batch_result = batch_response.result 
  #   if batch_result.success?
  #     batch_result.scrape_results.each do | result |
